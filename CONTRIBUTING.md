## Code Guidelines

- Use idiomatic Zig (`zig fmt` will help)
- Keep functions focused and low-level if possible
- Prefer clear naming over comments
- Avoid unnecessary allocations unless justified
- Use `std.testing` for test coverage

## Contributions We Love

- Adding new Redis command support (e.g. `DEL`, `HGETALL`, `INCR`)
